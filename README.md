# Gambling Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This was a fun Python script that I started during a timed programming challenge. The user interacts with the script and plays rock-paper-scissors against the Python script that randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors. You can also wager money to see how much money you could theoretically win by gambling on rock-paper-scissors games.
