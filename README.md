# Gambling Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

WHAT THE PROJECT DOES:
This was a fun Python script that I started during a 3 hour timed programming challenge. It's been a few years since I've done any programming, so I was really rusty. The user interacts with the script and plays rock-paper-scissors against the Python script that randomly selects from a list of strings containing "rock", "paper", or "scissors". You can also wager money to see how much money you could theoretically win by gambling on rock-paper-scissors games.

NEXT STEPS:
Lot's of validation is needed for this project. A few ideas:
1. If the user types a value outside of rock, paper, or scissors, throw an error message and have them try again.
2. If bank balance goes below $0, end the game
3. Validation if the user enters a non-integer value when asking how much they need to wager.
